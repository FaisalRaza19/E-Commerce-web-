    <h1>Welcome To TML.We're glad <br> and greatful you're here.</h1>
    <p>I can provide information about a shopping page or online shopping <br>
       in general. A shopping page typically refers to a web page or website <br>
       where users can browse and purchase products or services. Here are <br>
       some key aspects and components commonly found on a shopping page :</p>
    <button id="btn" onclick="show()">Let's Get Started</button>
    <img src="pic.jpg" alt="">
   
    <div class="para" id="text">
        <h2>Product Listings:-</h2>
        <p>This is where products or services are displayed. Each listing typically includes <br>
           an image, product name, description, price, and sometimes user reviews and ratings. <br>
           Users can click on these listings to view more details.
        </p>
        <h2>Shopping Cart:-</h2>
        <p>A shopping cart is a virtual container where users can add products they want to <br>
           purchase. It allows users to review and edit their selections before proceeding  <br>
           to the checkout process.</p>
        <h2>Checkout Process:-</h2>
        <p>This is where users finalize their purchase. They enter shipping and payment information and <br>
           confirm the order. Depending on the website, this process may consist of one or multiple steps.</p>
        <h2>Shipping and Delivery Information:-</h2>
        <p>Users should be provided with information about shipping options,estimated delivery times,<br>
           and any associated costs. They may also be able to track their orders.</p>
        <h2>Search and Filters:-</h2>
        <p>To help users find products efficiently, shopping pages often include search functionality and <br>
           filtering options. Users can search for specific products or narrow down their choices by criteria <br>
           such as price range, brand, and category.</p>
        <h2>Recommended Products:-</h2>
        <p>Many shopping websites use algorithms to suggest products to users based on their browsing and <br>
           purchasing history. This can enhance the shopping experience and increase sales.</p>
        <h2>Returns and Refunds:-</h2>
        <p>Information on the return policy, warranty, and the process for returning or <br>
           exchanging products should be available to users.</p>
        <h2>Terms and Conditions:-</h2>
        <p> Users should have access to the website's terms and conditions,including <br>
            privacy policies, shipping policies, and any other relevant legal information.</p>
